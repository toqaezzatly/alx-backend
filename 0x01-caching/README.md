# 0x01. Caching

## Project Overview

This project explores caching systems and different cache replacement algorithms. Caching systems are essential for optimizing data access times, reducing load, and enhancing overall system performance. Here, youâ€™ll implement various cache replacement policies and gain insight into how they manage and optimize cache storage.

### Key Topics:
- Cache replacement policies: FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU
- The purpose and limitations of a caching system

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Describe what a caching system is and its purpose.
- Explain and implement the following cache replacement policies:
  - **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out)
  - **LIFO** (Last-In-First-Out)
  - **LRU** (Least Recently Used)
  - **MRU** (Most Recently Used)
  - **LFU** (Least Frequently Used)
- Recognize the limitations of caching systems, including constraints on cache size and data eviction policies.

## Project Structure

This project includes a base class `BaseCaching` that provides the foundation for creating caching classes with specific policies. All caching classes should inherit from `BaseCaching`, which defines:
- **MAX_ITEMS**: A limit on cache size.
- **cache_data**: A dictionary where cached data is stored.

### Files

- `base_caching.py`: Defines the `BaseCaching` class with core functionalities and constraints.
- **Additional caching classes**: Implement the different cache replacement algorithms as subclasses of `BaseCaching`.
- **Testing files**: Contains scripts to test each caching policy.

### Requirements

- **Python Version**: 3.7 (interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
- **Code Style**: `pycodestyle` (version 2.5)
- **Documentation**: All modules, classes, and methods must include documentation describing their purpose.
- **Executable Files**: All files must be executable.

## Cache Replacement Policies

1. **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**:
   - Oldest items are removed first.
   
2. **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)**:
   - Most recently added items are removed first.
   
3. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**:
   - The item that has not been accessed for the longest time is removed.
   
4. **MRU (Most Recently Used)**:
   - The most recently accessed item is removed.
   
5. **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**:
   - The item that has been accessed the least frequently is removed.

## Usage

Each caching policy class should implement the `put()` and `get()` methods:
- **`put(key, item)`**: Adds an item to the cache with the specified key.
- **`get(key)`**: Retrieves the item associated with the given key.

## Running the Code

To test the cache replacement policies, you can run the included scripts or create your own:

```bash
python3 <your_test_file.py>
```

Example:
```bash
python3 0-main.py
```

### Style Check

Ensure code style compliance using:
```bash
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.py | ForEach-Object { python -m pycodestyle $_.FullName }
```
