# Pagination Project

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing pagination techniques in RESTful APIs using Python. Pagination is essential for managing large datasets and improving user experience by delivering data in manageable chunks. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

1. **Simple Pagination**: Implementing pagination using `page` and `page_size` parameters to divide a dataset into smaller sections.
2. **HATEOAS Pagination**: Utilizing hypermedia metadata to navigate through paginated data, providing links to the next, previous, and other relevant pages.
3. **Deletion-Resilient Pagination**: Designing pagination that remains functional even when items in the dataset are deleted, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## Requirements

- All files must be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7).
- Each file should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files must be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- Code must adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.*).
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All modules must have documentation accessible via `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.
- All functions must have documentation accessible via `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`.
- Documentation should be substantive, explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Setup

Use the `Popular_Baby_Names.csv` data file for your project. This dataset will be utilized to demonstrate the pagination techniques discussed.

## Conclusion

Pagination is a critical aspect of API design that enhances performance and usability. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with pagination strategies, preparing you to implement these techniques in real-world applications.
